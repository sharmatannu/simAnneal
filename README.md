sim_an.cpp is the main file the includes everything required to run the code. 
An example is hardcoded in the main, where 9 cells are required to be placed in a 3x3 matrix so as to minimize the total cost of wire.
The detailed description of the implementation and algorithm can be found in Simulated Annealing Algorithm.pdf
